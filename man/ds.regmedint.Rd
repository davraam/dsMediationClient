}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a string character, the name of the data frame containing the 
relevant variables.}

\item{yvar}{a character vector of length 1. Outcome variable name. It should be
the time variable for survival outcomes.}

\item{avar}{a character vector of length 1. Treatment variable name.}

\item{mvar}{a character vector of length 1. Mediator variable name.}

\item{cvar}{a character vector of length > 0. Covariate names. Use NULL if
there is no covariate. However, this is a highly suspicious situation. Even if
avar is randomized, mvar is not. Thus, there should usually be some confounder(s)
to account for the common cause structure (confounding) between mvar and yvar.}

\item{eventvar}{a character vector of length 1. Only required for survival outcome
regression models. Note that the coding is 1 for event and 0 for censoring, 
following the R survival package convention.}

\item{a0}{a numeric vector of length 1. Reference level of treatment variable that
is considered "untreated" or "unexposed".}

\item{a1}{a numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{m_cde}{a numeric vector of length 1. Mediator level at which controlled direct
effect is evaluated at.}

\item{c_cond}{a numeric vector of the same length as cvar. Covariate vector at which 
conditional effects are evaluated at.}

\item{mreg}{a character vector of length 1. Mediator regression type: "linear" or "logistic".}

\item{yreg}{a character vector of length 1. Outcome regression type: "linear", "logistic", 
"loglinear", "poisson", "negbin", "survCox", "survAFT_exp", or "survAFT_weibull".}

\item{interaction}{a logical vector of length 1. Default to TRUE. Whether to include a 
mediator-treatment interaction term in the outcome regression model.}

\item{casecontrol}{a logical vector of length 1. Default to FALSE. Whether data comes from
a case-control study.}

\item{na_omit}{a logical vector of length 1. Default to FALSE. Whether to use na.omit() function
in stats package to remove NAs in columns of interest before fitting the models.}

\item{exponentiate}{a logical vector of length 1. Default to FALSE. Whether to exponentiate
the estimates to measure the odds ratio incase of a logistic regression model.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} 
objects obtained after login. If the \code{datasources} argument is not specified
the default set of connections will be used: see \code{\link{datashield.connections_default}}.}
}
\value{
a summary table of the object of class 'multimed'.
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{regmedint} from the 
\code{regmedint} package.
}
\details{
The function \code{ds.regmedint} is used for regression-based causal mediation
analysis as described in Valeri & VanderWeele 2013 and Valeri & VanderWeele 2015.
